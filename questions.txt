 questions
 - code on github
 - what's in the .mat files
 - how is nature of new ids decided
 - what is meaning of burst
 - main:35 why add every other ccost value together?
 - sybilStump vs simulation_main_sybilControl
 
 
 
 conjecture
 - gen_session, gen_arrival: generates data from a curve?
 - '1' = good '2' = bad?
 (in simulation_main_sybilControl)
 - ccost = array with count of good ids at each time step?
 - sybil = percentage of system that is controlled by adversary at each time step??
