 questions
 - code on github OKAY
 - what's in the .mat files
 - how is nature of new ids decided
 - what is meaning of burst 
   different types of sybil attack
 - main:35 why add every other ccost value together?
 - sybilStump vs simulation_main_sybilControl
 
 
 
 conjecture
 - gen_session, gen_arrival: generates data from a curve?
 - '1' = good '2' = bad?
 (in simulation_main_sybilControl)
 - ccost = array with count of good ids at each time step? probably yes, this is the cost for the purge puzzle
 - sybil = percentage of system that is controlled by adversary at each time step?? 
 
 
 from meeting
 - new ccost algo:
   cost of purge is 1 per id 
   cost of entry puzzle is number of people who have joined so far / number of time steps in epoch
   calculate epoch by counting joins/departures. New epoch is when the number of ids in the network have increased or decreased by 1/3 from the initial size.
   At the start of new epoch, give out purge puzzle. This reduces the number of bad ids to alpha * number of bad ids / 3
